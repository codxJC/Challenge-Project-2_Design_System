# Codecademy Challenge-Project-2: Build a Website Design System

#### PROJECT SCOPE
This is my **Codecademy Challenge Project: _"Build a Website Design System_"**

The scope of the project was to test my Web Development skills using
HTML and CSS flexbox, and made a first attempt to create a responsive website.
This is not a project focused on ideal design.
This is a project to practice and learn.
